jcrud - Spring Booted Django admin clone


This is a little experiment that probably will not go anywhere. I love
Django's admin, and it annoys me to no end that there doesn't exist
anything else like it, especially for Java.

I'm a big fan of relational databases, and defining your entities in
anything else than SQL annoys me too, so jcrud will rely on the metadata
already found in your database (using SchemaCrawler).


TODO

* Search and filtering

* Non-crud operations

* Relational patterns

We should support UI representation of:

 * Outgoing foreign keys: as dropdowns or pickers
 * Incoming foreign keys: as editable tables
 * Primary foreign keys: as "polymorphic" forms

And support:

 * Composite primary keys


* Security

It should be possible to define fine-grained (table, row and column-level)
permissions.  We should include a sample relational model (role, user,
group, permission) with nested role support, but also allow total
customization and stuff such as LDAP integration.

This should include stuff like workflows ("state" fields possible values
depend on the current state, permissions of the user and other parameters).


* Auditing

We should include database-level auditing of changes integrated in the
frontend


* Multiple frontends

At the moment we aim for a progressively-enhanced HTML UI, but we should be
able to add different frontends (mobile apps, desktop apps, etc.) with
minimal work, by exposing the backend functionality via RPC.
